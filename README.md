### Geography

I live in Quebec City, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Mindstorms* by Seymour Papert
- *Welcome to the Monkey House* by Kurt Vonnegut
- *Persepolis* by Marjane Satrapi

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Patente & Machin in Quebec.
2. A-Float Sushi in Passadena.
